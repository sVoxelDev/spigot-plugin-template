??? faq "How can I debug my plugin?"
    There is a `debugPaper` Gradle task you can run. It will automatically download all dependencies and starts up a test server.  
    The server will be located under `bukkit/debug/`.  
    The feature is provided by [spigradle][spigradle]. An awesome gradle extension for developing Minecraft plugins.
