Here is the complete `config.yml` how it is shipped with the plugin. SpigotPluginTemplate will automatically save and overwrite a `config.default.yml` on every start.
The default config always contains the latest settings.  
You can also take a look at the [configuration reference][configuration] to see which options exist and when they were added.

??? example "config.yml"
    ```yaml
    --8<-- "bukkit/src/main/resources/config.yml"
    ```
